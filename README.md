A simple two-player Pong game built with Python's turtle graphics module. This is a fun project to understand the basics of object-oriented programming, game loops, and collision detection.

ðŸš€ Features

1.Classic Pong game mechanics

2.Two-player control (W/S and â†‘/â†“ keys)

3.Ball bouncing and increasing speed

4.Scoreboard with real-time updates

5.Organized using classes (Paddle, Ball, Scoreboard)

ðŸ§© What I Learned
1.Creating objects using classes in Python

2.Using the turtle module for animation

3.Detecting collisions and handling bouncing logic

4.Managing game state with loops and conditions
