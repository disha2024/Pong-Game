A simple two-player Pong game built with Python's turtle graphics module. This is a fun project to understand the basics of object-oriented programming, game loops, and collision detection.

ðŸš€ Features
Classic Pong game mechanics
Two-player control (W/S and â†‘/â†“ keys)
Ball bouncing and increasing speed
Scoreboard with real-time updates
Organized using classes (Paddle, Ball, Scoreboard)

ðŸ§© What I Learned
Creating objects using classes in Python

Using the turtle module for animation

Detecting collisions and handling bouncing logic

Managing game state with loops and conditions
